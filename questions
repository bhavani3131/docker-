The ADD command in Docker is used to copy files from a specified source location to a destination in the Docker image. It serves two primary functions: Copy local files from the host machine into the Docker image. Download files from a remote URL and add them to the Docker image.
The COPY instruction lets us copy a file (or files) from the host system into the image. 
CMD and ENTRYPOINT are two Dockerfile instructions that together define the command that runs when your container starts.
Use ENTRYPOINT instructions when building an executable Docker image using commands that always need to be executed. 
Use CMD instructions when you need an additional set of arguments that act as default instructions until there is explicit command-line usage when a Docker container runs
